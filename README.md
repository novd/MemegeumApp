<h4>MemegeumApp is ASP .NET Core MVC project. It parses memes from other sites and collect them in one place.</h4></br>

 -> General Parser is running continously and looking for fresh memes on multiple websites( whole internet at last).</br>
 -> Then Html Parser's extracting important parts (e.g. title, img source, tags)</br>
 -> Finally every collected meme is presented to user</br>
 -> User can filter memes by tags (move unwanted tags like movie spoilers to black list)</br>
